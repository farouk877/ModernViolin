# ModernViolin

Welcome to Farouk Marhaba and Naman Bhargava's *Modern Violin* Project!

We've created a stringless violin from the ground up, capable of virtual string selection, 
dynamic volume control, and fretting selection. To accomplish these tasks, we fused sensory
information from an accelerometer/gyroscope (bow angle), joystick (bow downpress magnitude), and Darlington-pair touch sensor (fretting).
